Option 1
- Insert entire file
    - Remove PC roles
        - Insert custom weapon WL & exotics
            - Remove duplicate community roles

Option 2
- Insert original community wish list and then insert exotics once meta is defined
    - Remove PC wishlist roles
        - Start to insert legendary weapons once weapon/role meta is defined


#2 seems more viable
